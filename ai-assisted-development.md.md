# AI-assisted development notes

This project was developed using AI-assisted coding tools to accelerate implementation and iteration.

All architectural decisions, workflow design, state management, database schema, error handling, and deployment configuration were designed, reviewed, and validated manually.

AI assistance was used as a productivity tool, not as a substitute for system design or ownership.
